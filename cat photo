<h1 style="color:red"> Cats</h1>
<p> Cats are a common household pet and have very soft fur. They have 4 paws and a moist nose. 
Thier noses are generally pink. They're eye colors vary from blue to green to brown. </p>
<p>They tend to make sounds like "meow", "hiss", and purr. Meowing is generally a sign of hello or wanting something.
They usually want petted, food, or a clean litter box. They are generally low maintenance and all the
owner has to do is clean the litter box, feed daily, and give them a bowl of water. Hissing is a 
a sign of they want whatever around them to stop. Purring is the best sound as it lets others know
that they are happy with whatever is going on. </p>
<p> Cats love to play or pounce on little toys. They also like to chase things as well.
